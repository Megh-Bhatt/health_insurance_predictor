## Health Insurance Predictor

This repository explores predicting health insurance premium amounts using individual characteristics. The code leverages the Random Forest algorithm and various Python libraries like scikit-learn and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

#### Libraries & Roles:

 - Scikit-learn: Provides the RandomForestRegressor algorithm for accurate predictions.
 - Pandas: Facilitates efficient data loading, manipulation, and exploration through DataFrames.
 - Numpy: Enables numerical computations and array operations for feature engineering and model training.
 - Plotly.express: Creates interactive visualizations like histograms and pie charts for data exploration.
#### How to use on your local device:
 - Download the repository
 - make a new folder extract the files in it
 - run the code once it will tell you the missing requirements download it.
 - After finally downloading the requirements you can train and experiment with the model
